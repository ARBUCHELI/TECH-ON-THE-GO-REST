* What is REST?
---------------
	. REST IS ONE WAY TO STRUCTURE AN API

	. AN API IS A SYSTEM FOR MAKING INFORMATION AVAILABLE OVER A NETWORK AND DESCRIBING HOW TO ACCESS THAT INFORMATION

	. AN API IS LIKE A MENU FOR A RESTAURANT

		. It describes the types of data available

		. How to request each type

	
	. API OPTIONS

		. REST

		. GraphQL

		. SOAP


	. REST (Representational State Transfer)

	. REST WAS DESIGNED FOR SYSTEMS THAT TRANSFER DATA OVER A NETWORK LIKE THE WEB. TO WORK WITH A DATA OBJECT REST CREATE A REPRESENTATION OF THAT OBJECT WHICH COMBINES THE DATA
	ITSELF WITH METADATA THAT DESCRIBES THE OBJECT.

	. THAT REPRESENTATION INCLUDES INFORMATION ABOUT EITHER THE CURRENT STATE OF THE OBJECT OR AN INTENDED CHANGED STATE, AND THE REPRESENTATION IS TRANSFERRED BETWEEN THE DIFFERENT
	COMPONENTS OF THE APPLICATION THAT'S WORKING WITH THE DATA. 

	* R E S T - IS AN ARCHITECTURE THAT USES A REPRESENTATION OF DATA TO COMMUNICATE ABOUT THE STATE OF THAT DATA BY TRANSFERRING THE REPRESENTATION BETWEEN COMPONENTS OF A NETWORKED
	APPLICATION.

* The problems that REST solves
-------------------------------
	. ROY FIELDING CREATED REST AND HTTP

	. THE DESIGN OF REST INFLUENCES THE ARCHITECTURE OF THE WEB

		. The focus on state transfer has enabled the development of web applications in multiple parts
		
			. Front-End

			. Back-End

	. WHEN USING REST, DATA CAN BE ANYTHING

		. This allowed to switch from XML to JSON


	. HATEOAS (HYPERTEXT AS THE ENGINE OF APPLICATION STATE)

		. IN A REST API, A REPRESENTATION INCLUDES INFORMATION ABOUT THE STATE OF AN OBJECT. IN FACT, THE ENTIRE REQUEST IS SUMMARIZED IN THAT STATE DESCRIPTION AND REST REPRESEN
		TATIONS CAN ALSO INCLUDE LINKS THAT LEAD TO OTHER POTENTIAL NEXT APPLICATION STATES.

		. ALTHOUGH THESE LINKS ARE FORMATTED FOR PROGRAMMATIC USE, RATHER THAN FOR USER INTERACTION, THEY'RE STILL A FORM OF HYPERTEXT, AND THE APPLICATION CAN THEN USE THIS 
		HYPERTEXT THAT'S INCLUDED AS PART OF THE REPRESENTATION, TO MOVE TO A NEW APPLICATION STATE.

		. AS REST WAS ORIGINALLY DESCRIBED, THE IDEA OF HYPERTEXT AS THE ENGINE OF APPLICATION STATE IS A CORE COMPONENT OF WHAT MAKES REST API, RESTFUL.
