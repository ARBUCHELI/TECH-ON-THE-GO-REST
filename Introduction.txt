* What is REST?
---------------
	. REST IS ONE WAY TO STRUCTURE AN API

	. AN API IS A SYSTEM FOR MAKING INFORMATION AVAILABLE OVER A NETWORK AND DESCRIBING HOW TO ACCESS THAT INFORMATION

	. AN API IS LIKE A MENU FOR A RESTAURANT

		. It describes the types of data available

		. How to request each type

	
	. API OPTIONS

		. REST

		. GraphQL

		. SOAP


	. REST (Representational State Transfer)

	. REST WAS DESIGNED FOR SYSTEMS THAT TRANSFER DATA OVER A NETWORK LIKE THE WEB. TO WORK WITH A DATA OBJECT REST CREATE A REPRESENTATION OF THAT OBJECT WHICH COMBINES THE DATA
	ITSELF WITH METADATA THAT DESCRIBES THE OBJECT.

	. THAT REPRESENTATION INCLUDES INFORMATION ABOUT EITHER THE CURRENT STATE OF THE OBJECT OR AN INTENDED CHANGED STATE, AND THE REPRESENTATION IS TRANSFERRED BETWEEN THE DIFFERENT
	COMPONENTS OF THE APPLICATION THAT'S WORKING WITH THE DATA. 

	* R E S T - IS AN ARCHITECTURE THAT USES A REPRESENTATION OF DATA TO COMMUNICATE ABOUT THE STATE OF THAT DATA BY TRANSFERRING THE REPRESENTATION BETWEEN COMPONENTS OF A NETWORKED
	APPLICATION.
